# --Train--
1. run python crawl_data.py to get images and save in ./images/
2. run python run.py to train the model (need tensorflow environment)
- training model  --- re_solver.py
- cnn net         --- re_cnn.py
- processing data --- data.py
- some functions  --- utils.py 

# --Test--
1. run python test.py to test the pre-trained model
- the pre-trained model is in Google Drive. You can download it there. https://drive.google.com/open?id=15bzDLEz_XKNN_eVS3lHntlDpJJqlpQwx
- The result will be color.jpg
